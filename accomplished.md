# PDFBox API Services - Accomplishments

## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive set of API services using Apache PDFBox and Spring Boot, providing a robust solution for PDF manipulation and processing through RESTful endpoints.

## Accomplishments

1. **Explored PDFBox Features**
   - Researched and analyzed the official PDFBox documentation
   - Identified key features suitable for API implementation
   - Determined technical requirements and dependencies

2. **Set up Spring Boot Project Structure**
   - Created a well-organized Maven project
   - Configured proper package structure following Spring Boot conventions
   - Set up application properties and configuration

3. **Implemented Eight PDFBox Features as API Services**
   - **Text Extraction**: Extract Unicode text from PDF files with options for maintaining positioning
   - **PDF Splitting**: Split PDFs into individual pages or by specified page ranges
   - **PDF Merging**: Combine multiple PDF files into a single document
